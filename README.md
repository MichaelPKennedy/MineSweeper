# MineSweeper
---
This project uses JFrame to build a playable MineSweeper game with a custom sized board. The program emphasizes the power of recursion with a recursive method used to expose all of the squares surrounding the square clicked until a square that borders a mine is reached. The program also relies on nested for loops to create and visit all of the JButtons on the board.
